# EDOS
E-DOS is a refreshed Disk Utility Package (DUP) that sits on top of a regular DOS, such as MyDOS or SpartaDos to provide a menu based disk operations in a friendly user interface. I have created this software to provide me with the best disk management experience that is simple yet full of missing functions classical interfaces did not have, such as sector copier, memory dump and more.

## The story behind the project
When I got my first Atari 600XL back in 1984 (after spending time each afternoon at my friend's place programming on his Atari 400), I taught myself Assembly and have started programming various utilies and games. I spent hours during school class to write Assembly code snippets in my special coding notebook. A few years back I've sumbled across that same notebook and noticed I've been working on my own version of Atari Disk Utility Package, or DOS menu.
Buying back my Atari setup and now migrating to the Atari 1200XL with 2 10150 disk drives and other peripherals, I bought myself an Assembly MAC/65 cartridge and resumed my teen project.
I've recently completed it with many functions I felt where missing from other solutions and am also actively using it in my day to day Atari activities.
